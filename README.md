# ❄️ Hangman – Winter Edition ❄️

Classic Hangman with a snowy twist, redesigned in two fun ways:

### ⛄ Save the Snowman

Wrong letters ❌ break parts of the snowman ⛄ and cost you a life ❤️.  
Win, and the snowman magically comes back ✨!

### ⛄ Build the Snowman

Guess letters 🔤 to build a snowman piece by piece 🧱.  
Wrong letters ❌ reduce your lives ❤️, so choose wisely!

In both games, guess the right shade of white 🎨.
